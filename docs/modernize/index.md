# Modernize in the cloud

Modernization is where you start capitalizing on the cloud. It's all about maximizing value and making the biggest impact with the least amount of effort. The result of modernization is an increase in operational efficiency. You can lower your management burdens and increase performance while minimizing cost. Less work and more productivity is how you rapidly meet and exceed objectives.

Below you'll find a brief overview of the modernization process. We've distilled the process into two steps:

- [Step 1. Business alignment](#step-1-business-alignment)
- [Step 2. Modernization strategies](#step-2-modernization-strategies)

## Step 1. Business alignment

We developed a framework that walks you through the most effective modernization processes. The first step is aligning your modernization to your business goals. Based on these goals, you'll determine:

- When to modernize
- What to modernize

You'll create a modernization roadmap that identifies the workloads you need to modernize and the modernization strategies you need to use.

With the modernization roadmap created, you can begin modernizing. You'll adopt new methodologies and new technologies to enhance your processes, applications, and databases.

## Step 2. Modernization strategies

Modernization is a loaded term. It means different things to different people. So letâ€™s define what we mean by modernization.

Modernization is enhancing your workloads and the process to support those workloads. Let's address each aspect:

- **Process modernization** - Modernizing your process means adopting a DevOps methodology. Process modernization must come before you modernize your workloads.

- **Workload modernization** - Modernizing your workloads means adopting platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS). This definition is oversimplified, but it applies to most scenarios.
